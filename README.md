# LANGCHAIN_AI_BOT
The code provided sets up a Flask web application that can load documents from a URL, process them, and provide a chatbot interface for user queries. It utilizes various components from the langchain library to handle document loading, text splitting, and embedding generation, while also providing RESTful API endpoints for interaction.

Key Components:
Environment Setup: Sets the OpenAI API key.
Document Loading: Loads documents from a specified URL.
Data Processing: Splits documents into manageable chunks.
Embedding Generation: Uses Hugging Face models to generate embeddings.
Flask Application: Initializes a Flask app with RESTful API endpoints for chatbot interaction.

Dependencies Used in the Project:
Flask: A web framework for building web applications in Python.

Package: flask
Flask-RESTful: An extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs.

Package: flask-restful
NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit, used for working with human language data.

Package: nltk
LangChain: A library for building applications with language models, which includes various components for document loading, text processing, embeddings, and chat models.

Packages:
langchain
langchain_community (for updated imports)
Hugging Face Transformers: A library for using pre-trained models for natural language processing tasks.

Package: transformers (if used locally)
Chroma: A vector store for managing embeddings.

Package: langchain_community.vectorstores
Summary:
These dependencies are essential for the functionality of the application, enabling it to load documents, process text, generate embeddings, and serve as a web API.
